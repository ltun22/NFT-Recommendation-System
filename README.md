# NFT Recommendation System

As Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have become prevalent innovations within the blockchain network and grown to be in demand, there is a major business opportunity and untapped sector for revenue. Recommendation systems have shown to impact revenue, drive engagement and consumption of content, and increase usage of platforms (Piyadigama & Poravi 2022). In order to drive legitimacy, liquidity and engagement onto the RMDS platform, we want to integrate an NFT recommendation system.


Our goal is to build a robust NFT recommendation system that correctly suggests and presents assets based on categorizations, search similarities, and overall popularities. We will be using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques to cluster NFTs based on their respective database collections. Then, we will record the cluster and their corresponding features to be categorized in the model. Second, the implementation of search similarity computation using NLP will be performed by utilizing user recommendation data. Lastly, the synthesis of the recommendation system will be residual on obtaining NFT trending/popularity in respect to price filter categorizations from past/present data to bestow a set of cryptographic assets to users. We will integrate this design and recommendation system into a non-coding User Experience prototype.


D&L Labs is a start-up research group that provides NFT marketplaces with cutting-edge user-centric recommendation innovations to expand and empower user engagement, accessibility and revenue for set platforms.

## Steps for Project


1. Download the NFT Historical Sale Dataset listed below
2. Use a processing software (Google Collab, Pycharm, etc) -- Note, our processor has limited datasize file for code
3. Main Steps in Projects

    a. Clean and Process NFT Historical Dataset
    b. NLP and Supervised Machine Learning

        - Create and execute natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniqurs to cluster NFTs based on NFT Dataset
        - record the cluster and their responding features to be categorized in the model

    c. Similarity Score

        - using NLP create a similarity score between users to get recommended NFTs

    d. Create NFT recommendation based on price filter / popularity

    e. create UX/UI design for NFT recommendation

4. Conclude with Results
